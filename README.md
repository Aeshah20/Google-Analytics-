# Google-Analytics

Google Analytics gives businesses the ability to track their business performance. It
provides you with various dashboards including but not limited to audience overview,
acquisitions overview, behavioral overview, and e-commerce. All of these areas are necessary
when understanding how well the business is performing and how you should shape your
marketing strategies.
The Google Store needs to market successfully to a larger demographic. The store has
such little traffic and has had massive decreases in performance from 2016 to 2017. The Google
store is not performing at its peak. Even though the store is seeing an increase in revenue, they
are not seeing an increase in users. If it's an individualâ€™s first time on the site, they
most likely will not return. The Google Store has almost no loyalty among its customers. The
Google store needs to build its brand and attract a more loyal demographic of people as well
as expand outside of the United States. The store has barely any international support.
Google also needs to update the compatibility on other devices like phones and tablets.
Most people are inseparable from their phones. They need to create more ads that appear on
these devices. Overall, the performance of the Google Store is utterly unsuccessful and Google
needs to develop more successful marketing campaigns to attract loyal customers
