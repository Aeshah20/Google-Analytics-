# What is Google Analytics?!

Google Analytics is an online Google platform that generates detailed statistics about a website’s traffic and traffic sources and measures website conversions and sales. A web traffic analysis application that collects, processes, and reports data from websites and apps to provide insights into user behavior, website performance, and business outcomes. 
Enables website owners to analyze their visitors, to interpret and optimize the website’s performance.
The purpose of Google Analytics is to help website owners measure and improve their website’s effectiveness and efficiency in achieving their goals, such as increasing sales, generating leads, enhancing user experience, etc.
helps website owners understand their audience, their needs, their preferences, and their feedback.


Google analytics gives business the ability to trach their business performance. It provides you with various dashboards including but not limited to audience overview, acquisitions overview, behavioral overview, and ecommerce. All of these areas are necessary when understanding how well the business is performing and how you should shape your marketing strategies.
The Google Store needs to market successfully to a larger demographic. The store has such little traffic and has massive decreases in performance from 2016 to 2017. The Google store is not performing at its peak. Even though the store is seeing an increase in revenue, they are not seeing an increase in users. In fact, if its an individual’s first time on the site, they most likely will not return. The Google Store has almost no loyalty amongst it customers. The google store need to build its brand and attract to a more loyal demographic of people as well as expand outside of the United States. The store has barely any international support.
Google also needs to update the compatibility on other devices like phones and tablet. Most people are inseparable from their phones. They need to create more ads that appear on these devices. Overall, the performance of the google store is utterly unsuccessful and Google need to develop more successful marketing campaigns to attract loyal customers.

# Customization-Dashboards

1.	Audience Snapshot
The Audience Snapshot gives the Google Store information on who visits the site, what time of visitor they are (new or returning), where the visitors are from, average pages per visit, average visit duration, tablet and mobile visits, etc.… It gives a mild overview of the behavioral habits of possible consumers. If the Google Store is able to better understand their audience then they can take steps to better market towards their consumers.
“Unique visitors” decreased from 2016 to 2017 from 843,094 to 705,204. This is the amount of people who visits a site at least once within the reporting period. However, each is only counted once during the reporting period. If an IP address is repeated then is still only counts as one visitor.
The number of visits decreased from 1,059,061 to 1,012,755. This just means that the Google Store had a fewer number of visits when compared to the year before.
If you were a new visit you probably weren’t going to come back. In 2016, the New Visitor vs Returning visitor ratio was 89.1% (New) vs 10.9%(Returning), and in 2017, the ratio was 85.5%(new) vs 14.5%(returning).
Most people who visited the site were from the United States of America in both 2016 to 2017. The Google store does not seem to have a large international presence with thins information.
Page Views have also decreased from 5,172,846 to 4,236,980. Less people are viewing their site.
Their bounce rate has increased from 46.38% to 48.75%. The rising bounce rate is a sign that the Google Store’s homepage is boring or off-putting. This is the number of visitors to a site that navigate away from the website after only viewing one page.
Visits by device: Desktop visits have decreased by 19.33% while mobile and tablet visits have both increased (mobile: 56.08% and tablet: 21.65%). This means that people are transitioning from using desktop computers to doing anything and everything on their mobile phones and tablets. Tablet and mobile visits are also categorized by type like Apple, Samsung, Google, and other. This should help google make decisions on how they should make their phones compatible and easier to use on each individual phone no matter the type.
Average pages per visit has decreased from 4.88 to 4.18. This means that people are not exploring the website completely. There could be various reasons for this behavior like the site is boring and hard to use, it doesn’t have the products the consumer was looking for, etc.
…
The average visit duration has increased from 2:16 minutes to 2:32 minutes. People are spending more time on the site which is positive information.
